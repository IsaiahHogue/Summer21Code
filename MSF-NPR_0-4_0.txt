The aid group Doctors without Borders is suspending its work in the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.(2)
BRUSSELS – The international medical humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) today releases a critical analysis of the Ebola epidemic in west Africa over the past year, revealing the shortcomings of the global response to the crisis and warning that the outbreak, despite an overall decline in cases, is not yet over.(1)
The move comes after two separate attacks on its treatment centers there.(2)
The report, Pushed to the limit and beyond, is based on interviews with dozens of MSF staff involved in the organisation’s Ebola intervention.(1)
It describes MSF’s early warnings one year ago about cases of Ebola spreading in Guinea, the initial denial by governments of the affected countries, and the unprecedented steps that MSF was forced to take in the face of global inaction as the outbreak engulfed neighbouring states.(1)
Over the past year, more than 1,300 MSF international staff and 4,000 local staff have been deployed in west Africa, where they cared for nearly 5,000 confirmed Ebola patients.(1)

Today we share our initial reflections and take a critical look at both MSF’s response and the wider global response to the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history.(1)

“Today we share our initial reflections and take a critical look at both MSF’s response and the wider global response to the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history,” says Dr Joanne Liu, MSF international president.(1)
“The Ebola epidemic proved to be an exceptional event that exposed the reality of how inefficient and slow health and aid systems are to respond to emergencies.”

The report details the effects of the several months-long “global coalition of inaction,” during which the virus spread wildly, leading MSF to issue a rare call for the mobilisation of international civilian and military medical assets with biohazard capacity.(1)
By the end of August, MSF’s ELWA3 centre in Monrovia was overwhelmed with patients.(1)
Staff were forced to turn away visibly ill people from the front gate, in the full knowledge that they would likely return to their communities and infect others.(1)
“The Ebola outbreak has often been described as a perfect storm: a cross-border epidemic in countries with weak public health systems that had never seen Ebola before,” says Christopher Stokes, MSF general director.(1)
“Yet this is too convenient an explanation.(1)
The organization says, at best, it will be weeks before it returns.(2)
"When I send my teams I need to be sure that they are going to come back alive," says Emmanuel Massart, the on-the-ground emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders in the region.(2)
For the Ebola outbreak to spiral this far out of control required many institutions to fail.(1)
And they did, with tragic and avoidable consequences.”

The report also lays out the challenges MSF faced over the past year and the difficult choices made in the absence of available treatment and sufficient resources.(1)
While MSF’s Ebola experience is limited to a relatively small group of experts, it should have mobilised more resources earlier.(1)
"The attacks were really, really violent."(2)
The first took place last Sunday night.(2)
Facing an exceptionally aggressive epidemic and a weak international response, MSF teams focused on damage control.(1)
"It started around ten o'clock," says Massart.(2)
Somewhere between 20 to 100 men converged on the group's treatment center in a rural suburb called Katwa.(2)
"They started to throw stones.(2)
And then they started to put part of the center on fire – where we had all the logistical and water and sanitation equipment.(2)
And then ... the triage center and the cars."(2)
After about 15 minutes the attackers scattered.(2)
Unable to do everything, compromises had to be made between the competing priorities of patient care, surveillance, safe burials and outreach activities, amongst others.(1)
“At the most severe periods of the outbreak, MSF teams were unable to admit more patients or provide the best possible care,” says Dr Liu.(1)
But the center was already in ruins.(2)
“This was extremely painful for an organisation of volunteer medics, leading to heated exchanges and tensions within MSF.”

MSF’s process of reflection is underway, as it seeks to learn lessons that can be applied to future outbreaks, while documenting and analysing its patient data to examine the multiple factors that can contribute to Ebola mortality.(1)
Crucially, a global strategy to sustain research and development for Ebola vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tools must be developed.(1)
A significant challenge remains ahead.(1)
The next attack was on Wednesday night — at a treatment center seven miles away, in a city called Butembo.(2)
This time the assailants were even more brazen.(2)
"They used a car to ram the gate," says Massart.(2)
To declare an end to the outbreak, every single person in contact with someone infected with Ebola must be identified.(1)
"There were men inside.(2)
They divide in different teams.(2)
They start to destroy things.(2)
There is no room for mistakes or complacency; the number of cases weekly is still higher than in any previous outbreak, and overall cases have not significantly declined since late January.(1)
In Guinea, patient numbers are again rising.(1)
They start shooting.(2)
In Sierra Leone, many people are presenting with the virus who were not previously on lists of known Ebola contacts.(1)
On 20 March, a patient tested positive for Ebola in Monrovia, the first confirmed case in more than two weeks after the last known case was discharged in Liberia.(1)
“The trauma of Ebola has left people distrustful of health facilities, has left health workers demoralised and fearful of resuming services, and has left communities bereaved, impoverished and suspicious,” the report says.(1)
In the three worst affected countries, nearly 500 health workers have lost their lives in the past year, a disastrous blow to an already serious shortfall of staff before the Ebola crisis hit.(1)
So the police arrive and they start shooting at each other."(2)
The gun battle lasted about 30 minutes.(2)
One officer was killed.(2)
At the time, there were several dozen patients at the center who were suspected or confirmed to have Ebola.(2)
It is urgent that access to health services is restored as a first step towards rebuilding functional health systems in the region.(1)
“Global failures have been brutally exposed in this epidemic and thousands of people have paid for it with their lives.(1)
Many of them just picked up and ran.(2)
It is to everyone’s benefit that lessons be learned from this outbreak, from the weakness of health systems in developing countries, to the paralysis and sluggishness of international aid,” the report concludes.(1)
Massart arrived on the scene soon after and says everyone was traumatized.(2)
His colleagues told him, "You are afraid for your life.(2)
You feel completely helpless."(2)
Officials of the World Health Organization say several patients are still at large.(2)
The rest have been moved to a center in Katwa operated by another international charity, called Alima.(2)
The facility was originally a transit center to house people suspected of Ebola until they could be moved somewhere else for treatment.(2)
But the government and WHO are working with Alima to equip it to offer the full panoply of care.(2)
The need is great.(2)
Katwa is the newest hot spot in this seven-month-long outbreak, with more than 200 new cases in recent weeks that bring the overall total in Congo to nearly 900 cases.(2)
Massart says despite this dire prognosis, Doctors Without Borders will not return until it can be sure there will be no more attacks.(2)
Requesting protection from the Congolese police or military or even United Nations peacekeepers is not an option, he says.(2)
"It's a general principle of Doctors Without Borders that if you accept the protection of one side you will be the target of the other," he says.(2)
Instead, the group maintains that the best way to stay safe is to make sure you win the support of the community.(2)
"Normally, the population understands that you are doing something good for them, so they will protect you," he says.(2)
And while it's not yet known who the assailants were in the two attacks, Massart says the larger takeaway is clear.(2)
In Katwa and Butembo, "there is a level of mistrust that we have to correct very, very quickly."(2)
He adds that it's not surprising.(2)
Katwa and Butembo are in an isolated, impoverished area with a history of armed conflict that's made people wary of — and sometimes even hostile to — outsiders.(2)
Add to this the fact that Ebola is a disease that has never reached this region before and that at first blush doesn't seem all that different from more familiar diseases.(2)
"At the beginning you will have the same symptoms as malaria or typhoid fever – things that the communities are used to dealing with.(2)
So Ebola is seen as a disease like the other ones, and they don't see why we should put people in treatment centers."(2)
After all, malaria can be deadly too.(2)
But there have never been foreign medical workers insisting that as soon as a family member shows signs of it you need to send them off to a bunch of strangers in plastic suits.(2)
This mistrust has serious consequences beyond the attacks.(2)
Because people aren't coming forward for treatment, a very high share are dying of Ebola in their communities.(2)
And at that end stage of the disease, they are at their most contagious.(2)

Why Does Ebola Keep Spreading In Congo?(2)
Here's A Major Clue
Doctors Without Borders and other groups have done some work educating communities about Ebola.(2)
But the approach has been too top down, says Massart.(2)
Instead, "we should have involved the community in the decision making."(2)
For instance, he says, instead of simply erecting the Ebola treatment center in a location chosen by the government, "we should have gone to the community and said, 'Where do you think we should put it?'(2)
"

The failure to consult the local population seems surprising given that Doctors Without Borders has a long history of treating Ebola in areas where there's been community resistance.(2)
And the Katwa center was opened in January, long after numerous other episodes of violent resistance in earlier hot spots of the current outbreak.(2)
Massart says part of the problem is that there are so many different groups involved in the response – and each one handles different aspects.(2)
"We are very known for patient care, and that's where we have been put," he says.(2)
"There were other people that were in charge of community engagement and communication.(2)
So we didn't do it ourselves because it was supposed to be done and done well [by others.](2)
But unfortunately it was not."(2)
Now he says, Doctors Without Borders is rethinking its role.(2)
The group will continue to provide patient care in other less violent areas of the outbreak.(2)
But in Katwa and Butembo, he wonders: "Is patient care where we will have the biggest impact?(2)
Or should we put more forces in community engagement?"(2)
